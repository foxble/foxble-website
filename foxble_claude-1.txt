how well will this subdomain https://datahub.foxble.com pointing to http://18.246.13.6/login integrate with the vercel website? or since http://18.246.13.6/login is coming from aws it would be better to stick with aws for the website or it really does not make that much of a differnce hosting the site on vercel?
